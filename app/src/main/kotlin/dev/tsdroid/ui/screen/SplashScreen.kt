 * It stays up until the app has what it needs to look finished, which — with the wallpaper switched
 * on — means the image has been downloaded, decoded and turned into the theme colour behind it.
 * Previously this screen was decoration: it ran on fixed delays while the app behind it started from
 * an empty background and downloaded the same image a second time, so the wallpaper was still
 * visibly arriving long after the splash was gone.
 *
 * [animeBackground] is the setting the caller has already read, or `null` while that read is still in
 * flight. The splash waits for it on purpose: whether there is anything to wait for at all depends on
 * it, and the screen that follows starts from the same answer (see [AppNavigation]).
